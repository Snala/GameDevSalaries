# Game Dev Salaries Project
This is a project to clean the data provided in the GameDev spreadsheet, into something that is usable and importable into Tableau.

With the data in Tableau and formatted nicely, we can then create visuals.

## Credits
The data comes from http://bit.ly/GameDevSalaries2021 maintained by Evva Karr, and questions on this spreadsheet should be directed to @EvvaKarr on Twitter ot email evva at hey.com.

A snapshot of the data at the time I am working on this project is included within the /data/ folder, but I encourage you to use fresh data directly from http://bit.ly/GameDevSalaries2021 whenever possible.
