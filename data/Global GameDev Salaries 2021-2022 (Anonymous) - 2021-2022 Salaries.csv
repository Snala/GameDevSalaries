1. Tailor your resume to match the language in the job description. Don't lie, but mirror the phrasing they use to convey that you know what they're asking for and that you are capable of doing it. Make it as easy as possible for them to check the box that says ""this person has what it takes.""

2. In your interview, ask significant questions when they ask you ""do you have any questions for me."" Take them to task about their culture with regards to crunch and PTO, how moonlighting or outside work is handled, how failure is handled by management, what advancement and development opportunities have been afforded to your interviewers and what will be available to you. Take diligent notes, and if you ask the same questions to multiple interviewers, compare them to see if there's internal consistency. 

3. When you get an offer, YOU SHOULD NEGOTIATE YOUR SALARY. Google ""Kalzumeus Salary Negotiation"" for a great primer. You are worth the money, you are worth the effort. Don't let them trick you into settling for less.",

This is stressful, but the only way I've received any substantial increase to my income is by switching companies. Before my current company, I hadn't had more than 2 paid weeks off per year. Most jobs I've worked required a significant amount of overtime, the worst of which was year-round 70 hour weeks on average.",,"When being asked for your salary requirements, ask the company to place a value on the position first. If they won't disclose that, ask for 20% more than you think you should; it is much harder to negotiate up than down. While the nature of capitalism dictates that a company hiring employees will always pay the worker less money than they're actually worth, it is possible to be mostly fairly compensated if you're able to negotiate it. Try your best not to accept a salary or hourly rate that you cannot afford, and ideally don't accept one that's significantly less than you're worth. Factor in benefits as well when determining this, and always try to have a target number in mind when considering your minimum acceptable salary. Don't forget that when you're contracting (not a full time employee) you are financially responsible for self-employment taxes as well as your own healthcare! This means your rate should be higher to compensate. Regardless of your employment status, accepting less income hurts the ENTIRE industry. Also, your labor carries the same value no matter where you work from. That said, our industry already has most of us underpaid, frequently laid off, and scrambling to keep money rolling in, so it becomes very difficult to turn down lower salaries. Just know that there is always another job out there. To that point, it's always good practice to interview even if you're not looking. When you have two companies trying to hire you, you have much more leverage to negotiate a better salary. Also, don't work for exposure. Internships should be paid. And lastly, but maybe most importantly, be extra critical about a company's culture and diversity. You'll be around these people for a great lot of your time! You are interviewing the company as much as they are interviewing you!",
